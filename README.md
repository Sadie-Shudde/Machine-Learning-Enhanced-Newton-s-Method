# Machine-Learning-Enhanced-Newton-s-Method
This projects aims to see how classical root-finding methods compare to each other, and how they to Machine-Learning (ML) enhanced versions. The classical methods used consist of Bisection, Secant, and Newton-Raphson. The first ML enhanced version is Newton-Raphson were the ML model predicts better initial guesses.
